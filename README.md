# Hi, I’m Saaketh 👋

Software engineer focused on building reliable systems, writing clean code, and understanding *why* things work—not just *how*.

I care about correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability. I’m skeptical of hype, allergic to overengineering, and biased toward simple, testable solutions.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Backend systems and APIs
- Scalable, data-driven applications
- Clean architecture and system design
- Practical problem-solving over theoretical excess

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (varies by problem)

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Backend:** REST APIs, microservices, async systems  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, NoSQL (when justified)  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Linux, CI/CD  
- **Concepts:** Data structures, algorithms, system design, concurrency

I choose tools based on constraints, not trends.

## 📌 Philosophy

- Simple > clever  
- Correct > fast (until fast matters)  
- Readability is a feature  
- If it can’t be explained clearly, it’s probably wrong  

---

## 📈 Interests

- Software engineering best practices  
- Business & markets  
- Technology that survives contact with reality
